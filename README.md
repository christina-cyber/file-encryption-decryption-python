Python project for file encryption and decryption using AES/Fernet
# File Encryption and Decryption Using Python

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt files using Python and the **cryptography** library. The encryption is done using the **Fernet** symmetric encryption algorithm.

## How to Use

### 1. Generate a Key
First, you need to generate an encryption key using the following command:

```bash
python encryption.py
